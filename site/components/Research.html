    >During its thirty years of existence, the World Wide Web has helped to
    transform the world and create digital economies. Although it started as a
    global information exchange, it has become the most significant available
    application platform on top of its initial target. One of the side effects
    of this evolution was perhaps suboptimal ways to deliver content over the
    web, leading to wasted resources and business through lost conversions.
    Technically speaking, there are many ways to improve the performance of web
    applications. In this article, we examine the currently available options
    and the latest trends related to improving web application
    performance.</slot

    >Hydration is a common technique employed by current JavaScript-based
    frontend frameworks, such as React. In hydration, the application code is
    re-executed on the client to recover component boundaries, application
    state, and event listeners. In this article, we look into a new primitive
    called resumability that avoids thework as the necessary information is
    serialized into HTML. The idea has been adopted by Asta (2023), Google Wiz,
    Marko (planned for version 6 [1]), Sidewind (since 2022), and Qwik (2021) as
    a main building block. Resumability gives these solutions unique advantages
    by avoiding the cost of hydration. Furthermore, resumability can allow
    developers to leverage code-splitting out of the box, depending on the
    implementation. The shift has implications for both developer and user
    experience. This article aims to understand why resumability matters and why
    it is a good option for replacing earlier hydration-based approaches. We
    also consider challenges related to adopting resumability on a framework
    level and briefly highlight the first resumable solutions for developing web
    applications.</slot

    >A significant portion of the web is powered by ECMAScript. As a web
    technology, it is ubiquitous and available on most platforms natively or
    through a web browser. ECMAScript is the dominant language of the web, but
    at the same time, it was not designed as such. The story of ECMAScript is a
    story of the impact of standardization on the popularity of technology.
    Simultaneously, the story shows how external pressures can shape a
    programming language and how politics can mar the evolution of a standard.
    In this article, we will go through the movements that led to the dominant
    position of ECMAScript, evaluate the factors leading to it, and consider its
    evolution using the Futures Triangle framework and the theory of standards
    wars.</slot

    >The evolution of the web can be characterized as an emergence of frameworks
    paving the way from static websites to dynamic web applications. As the
    scope of web applications has grown, new technical challenges have emerged,
    leading to the need for new solutions. The latest of these developments is
    the rise of so-called disappearing web frameworks that question the axioms
    of earlier generations of web frameworks, providing benefits of the early
    web and simple static sites.</slot

    >Static site generation (SSG) is a common technique in the web development
    space to create performant websites that are easy to host. Numerous SSG
    tools exist, and the approach has been complemented by newer approaches,
    such as Jamstack, that extend its usability. Edge computing represents a new
    option to extend the usefulness of SSG further by allowing the creation of
    dynamic sites on top of a static backdrop, providing dynamic resources close
    to the user. In this paper, we explore the impact of the recent developments
    in the edge computing space and consider its implications for SSG.
