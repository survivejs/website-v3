    >Based on a rough estimate, the ICT industry consumes 7 to 10% of the world’s energy,
    and around 70% of this is related to usage while the rest can be considered embodied
    due to manufacturing, logistics, and related activities. Simultaneously, the web has
    become an important channel for consuming ICT services as it is the largest available
    application platform globally. Especially energy consumption of mobile web applications
    has been studied in detail, but there is a clear research gap for web applications
    because suitable measurement tooling has not been available earlier.The purpose of this
    article is to review the current state of the art and understand how to approximate the
    energy consumption of web applications effectively by measuring an existing website that
    has been implemented with two different web frameworks—Qwik and Next.js. Our main
    findings indicate that although services that approximate energy consumption of web
    applications exist, they tend to overestimate consumption when compared to our
    measurements and they may even show contradictory results between different web
    frameworks. Further, we found that Firefox Profiler can be used to measure energy
    consumption with high precision. We also found that Website Carbon service fails to
    acknowledge techniques, such as lazy rendering, and there were open questions related
    to hosting detection (green or not) while the service was not transparent in calculating
    the results—not disclosing intermediary results or exposing the scope of the calculation.
    Our key recommendation is to use CPU-based measurement methods in estimating web
    energy consumption.</slot

  title="The Potential of Serverless Edge-powered Islands for Web Development (2025)"

    >Web developers face two significant challenges when developing their
    applications and websites: latency and payload size. Given that web services
    rely on servers, the related communication incurs a cost in terms of
    latency. In contrast, the payload passed to the client incurs a
    communication cost, not to mention the computational cost to the client. The
    concept of serverless edge computing, built on top of content delivery
    networks (CDNs), is an approach that has begun to gain the attention of web
    developers for its promise of lower latencies due to its efficiencies in
    communication thanks to globally distributed networks and replication.
    Islands architecture is a technical approach that addresses payload size by
    giving developers easy ways to defer and potentially even avoid the cost of
    loading content. Combined, these two approaches form edge-powered islands
    and, in this article, we examine how the combination can help to address
    these two notable costs web developers have to consider in their daily work.
    Our findings indicate that edge-powered islands can provide a way to
    introduce interactivity to otherwise static websites while wrapping dynamic
    portions of a page within islands to gain the benefits of static approaches
    in more dynamic contexts, such as storefronts. In addition, islands can
    provide loading benefits even for more application-like websites, such as
    social networks, and give web developers an additional control layer in
    their development work.</slot

    >During its thirty years of existence, the World Wide Web has helped to
    transform the world and create digital economies. Although it started as a
    global information exchange, it has become the most significant available
    application platform on top of its initial target. One of the side effects
    of this evolution was perhaps suboptimal ways to deliver content over the
    web, leading to wasted resources and business through lost conversions.
    Technically speaking, there are many ways to improve the performance of web
    applications. In this article, we examine the currently available options
    and the latest trends related to improving web application
    performance.</slot

  <slot name="content"
    >Hydration is a common technique employed by current JavaScript-based
    frontend frameworks, such as React. In hydration, the application code is
    re-executed on the client to recover component boundaries, application
    state, and event listeners. In this article, we look into a new primitive
    called resumability that avoids thework as the necessary information is
    serialized into HTML. The idea has been adopted by Asta (2023), Google Wiz,
    Marko (planned for version 6 [1]), Sidewind (since 2022), and Qwik (2021) as
    a main building block. Resumability gives these solutions unique advantages
    by avoiding the cost of hydration. Furthermore, resumability can allow
    developers to leverage code-splitting out of the box, depending on the
    implementation. The shift has implications for both developer and user
    experience. This article aims to understand why resumability matters and why
    it is a good option for replacing earlier hydration-based approaches. We
    also consider challenges related to adopting resumability on a framework
    level and briefly highlight the first resumable solutions for developing web
    applications.</slot

    >A significant portion of the web is powered by ECMAScript. As a web
    technology, it is ubiquitous and available on most platforms natively or
    through a web browser. ECMAScript is the dominant language of the web, but
    at the same time, it was not designed as such. The story of ECMAScript is a
    story of the impact of standardization on the popularity of technology.
    Simultaneously, the story shows how external pressures can shape a
    programming language and how politics can mar the evolution of a standard.
    In this article, we will go through the movements that led to the dominant
    position of ECMAScript, evaluate the factors leading to it, and consider its
    evolution using the Futures Triangle framework and the theory of standards
    wars.</slot

  <slot name="content"
    >The evolution of the web can be characterized as an emergence of frameworks
    paving the way from static websites to dynamic web applications. As the
    scope of web applications has grown, new technical challenges have emerged,
    leading to the need for new solutions. The latest of these developments is
    the rise of so-called disappearing web frameworks that question the axioms
    of earlier generations of web frameworks, providing benefits of the early
    web and simple static sites.</slot

  <slot name="content"
    >Disappearing frameworks represent a new type of thinking for web
    development. In the current mainstream JavaScript frameworks, the focus has
    been on developer experience at the cost of user experience. Disappearing
    frameworks shift the focus by aiming to deliver as little, even zero,
    JavaScript to the client. In this paper, we look at the options available in
    the ecosystem in mid-2023 and characterize them in terms of functionality
    and features to provide a state-of-the-art view of the trend. We found that
    the frameworks rely heavily on compilers, often support progressive
    enhancement, and most of the time support static output. While solutions
    like Astro are UI library agnostic, others, such as Marko, are more
    opinionated.</slot

  <slot name="content"
    >Static site generation (SSG) is a common technique in the web development
    space to create performant websites that are easy to host. Numerous SSG
    tools exist, and the approach has been complemented by newer approaches,
    such as Jamstack, that extend its usability. Edge computing represents a new
    option to extend the usefulness of SSG further by allowing the creation of
    dynamic sites on top of a static backdrop, providing dynamic resources close
    to the user. In this paper, we explore the impact of the recent developments
    in the edge computing space and consider its implications for SSG.
