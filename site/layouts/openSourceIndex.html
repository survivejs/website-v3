        >I have been working with open source since 2004 as I started
        contributing to [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Later on I was a
        part of the group that established the core team of
        [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Besides working on well-known
        projects, I have developed numerous small projects of my own. Given
        there are too many to mention, I have highlighted several I consider
        interesting on this page. You can [find more behind my GitHub
        profile](https://github.com/bebraw).
