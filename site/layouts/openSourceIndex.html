        >I have been working with open source since 2004 as
        I started contributing to
        [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Later on I was
        a part of the group that established the core team
        of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Besides
        working on well-known projects, I have developed
        numerous small projects of my own. Given there are
        too many to mention, I have highlighted several I
        consider interesting on this page. You can [find
        more behind my GitHub

            >The development of colorjoe color picker was
            motivated by a need to find a light picker that
            doesn't rely on static images. The solution was
            to use CSS to generate gradients and let the
            browser compose them. Although the project is
            old, it is still somehow relevant even
            today.</slot

            >Reactabular was perhaps the first headless
            table component built for React. It was built
            during the time when headless didn't exist at a
            time. Although the project started from my
            personal interest, its development was later
            funded by [Kenandy](https://www.kenandy.com/)
            and [Kleiner
            Perkins](https://www.kleinerperkins.com/). If
            funding appeared, I would be happy to modernize
            the library.</slot

            >Antwar was my first serious static site
            generator. I developed it around React and
            webpack to develop this website and other
            smaller projects. The unique feature at the time
            had to do with interactive components which
            could include small pieces of React code to
            avoid the problem of having to hydrate the whole
            webpage. Later on this idea has been formalized
            as the idea of islands architecture.</slot

            book](/books/webpack/), I realized it is
            difficult to explain how to construct webpack
            configurations in a simple way. To allow
            composition, I wrote webpack-merge. I consider
            the project feature complete and I am thankful
            to Google for supporting my efforts with a
            one-time $3000 grant from their infrastructure
            fund.</slot

            >After getting exposed to
            [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), I started
            thinking it would be a good idea to do the same
            but for state. Sidewind was born out of this
            experiment and it includes a small (~5k) runtime
            for managing state. As a unique feature, it
            implements the basic idea of resumability. In
            other words, it is able to construct its state
            from the initial HTML markup. It is possible
            I'll rewrite the project as a compiler one
            day.</slot

            >As I realized the approach of Antwar is too
            constraining and I wanted to learn
            [Deno](https://deno.com/), I decided to start
            working on
            [Tailspin](https://github.com/survivejs/tailspin).
            The initial idea was to combine the ideas of a
            static site generator with a design system tool
            but the initial attempt was a technical dead
            end. In Gustwind, I started from a JSON
            definition for components due to its simplicity.
            Later on I understood it's not fun to author and
            ended up developing a HTML dialect called
            [HTMLisp](https://gustwind.js.org/templating/).
            This site has been rewritten using the approach
            and likely there are still many fun features to
            add (interactive editing on web etc.).</slot
