        >I have been working with open source since 2004 as
        I started contributing to
        [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Later on I was
        a part of the group that established the core team
        of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Besides
        working on well-known projects, I have developed
        numerous small projects of my own. Given there are
        too many to mention, I have highlighted several I
        consider interesting on this page. You can [find
        more behind my GitHub
        profile](https://github.com/bebraw).

            >Reactabular was perhaps the first headless
            table component built for React. It was built
            during the time when headless didn't exist at a
            time. Although the project started from my
            personal interest, its development was later
            funded by [Kenandy](https://www.kenandy.com/)
            and [Kleiner
            Perkins](https://www.kleinerperkins.com/). If
            funding appeared, I would be happy to modernize
            the library.</slot
