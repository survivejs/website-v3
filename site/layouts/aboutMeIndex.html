        am Juho Veps채l채inen, a seasoned web developer. I developed my first
        website around 1996 although it has been lost to the history and I was
        not serious about web development back then. It was only in early 2000s
        that I started to become more serious about programming as I became
        involved with the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) project for
        several years starting from 2005 as I contributed to the project by
        coding and improving documentation. I was one of the founders of
        [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) core team and helped to establish the
        project to a broader public through [my webpack book](/books/webpack/).
        I have also authored numerous [open source](/open-source/) projects
        primarily for my own purposes, although several have become popular on
        their own as other people and companies have found my work useful. At
        the moment I pursue a PhD at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/)
        and so far I have produced numerous [research outputs](/research/)
        related to web development and mentored several students in their BSc
        and MSc work.

        >I established my own company in 2016 to support my publishing efforts.
        I use the company for occasional [consulting](/consulting/) while giving
        [workshops](/workshops) and [presentations](/presentations/) as
        opportunities arise. I have been organizing conferences primarily in
        Finland starting from 2018 as the first [React
        Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) conference took place then. Since
        that time, we have pivoted into a new brand called [Future
        Frontend](https://futurefrontend.com/) to allow discussion about
        future-oriented web topics beyond React.</Markdown

        >You can consider this site as my collection of web related knowledge.
        It is primarily a learning resource for beginner to intermediate
        developers although especially the research portions cover advanced,
        bleeding edge material. I am not overly active on social media, but you
        can find me in the following places:</Markdown
