              >Building web application user interfaces has become increasingly
              complex due to heightened expectations and requirements in
              interface customizability, visual appeal, performance, and
              accessibility. This has given birth to frontend tools like
              Storybook.js that help developers manage the development
              complexity through component isolation and test automation.
              Storybook is mainly used by developers to build and maintain
              design systems that can be used to construct UIs across
              applications regardless of the different application contexts.
              This thesis explores developer experiences with using Storybook to
              build and maintain design systems, identifying some benefits and
              drawbacks of the tool in the process. The developer experiences
              are inspected from the task viewpoints of
              designer-developer-handoff, component programming, and component
              testing. For each task, the Storybook way of approaching it is
              explained first. That is followed by a case study of using
              Storybook to help with that task in a software company. Finally,
              some observations are made from the experiences of using Storybook
              for that specific task. The final discussion presents and argues
              for four observations about Storybook. Firstly, Storybook offers
              approachable component workshopping. Secondly, Storybook doubles
              well as rich component documentation. Thirdly, there exist
              numerous add-ons to further leverage the use of Storybook.
              Finally, to fully leverage the capabilities of Storybook,
              developers must spend quite a lot of effort first configuring the
              tool and later creating and maintaining all of its content. The
              consensus of the developer experiences on building design systems
              using Storybook was positive.</slot

              >The rise of JavaScript meta-frameworks has transformed the
              development of web applications in recent years. Alongside
              established frameworks, such as Next.js, more recent entrants,
              such as Astro and Qwik City have introduced novel approaches
              centred on simplifying developer experience and improving the
              perceived performance of applications for users. The competitive
              nature of the meta-framework space and the long-term impact of
              framework choice on projects calls for an understanding of the
              factors that drive framework adoption. This research first
              delineates extensibility, ease of migration and updates as a set
              of adoption factors based on prior research and their relevance to
              modern meta- frameworks. The factors form a basis of evaluating
              three meta-frameworks—Next.js, Astro, and Qwik City—selected based
              on their popularity, design, and phase on the innovation curve. A
              developer survey is conducted to complement the analysis,
              gathering insights from developers on the value they associate
              with architectural aspects and their personal experiences with the
              selected frameworks. The findings substantiate previous research
              that identified learnability and extensibility as primary adoption
              drivers. The main risks driving unadoption involve complexity
              associated with a high degree of configurability and the perceived
              framework lock-in due to an abundance of framework-specific
              concepts. Despite shared authoring experiences across evaluated
              meta-frameworks, the analysis indicates that newer frameworks are
              showing potential to considerably enhance user and developer
              experiences by focusing on a simplified authoring experience,
              addressing issues related to the transmission of application logic
              from the server to the client and providing more fine-grained
              approaches to managing client-side JavaScript.</slot

              >Modern JavaScript frameworks have enabled the development of
              interactive and user-friendly web applications. Over the past
              decade, React has become the leading user interface framework in
              the JavaScript world, contributing to the rise of Single Page
              Applications (SPA). However, the extensive development of SPAs has
              led to an increase in the amount of client-side JavaScript, thus
              triggering performance issues in terms of initial loading
              times.<br />The speed at which a web application is initially
              rendered can significantly influence its potential for revenue
              generation, as the initial loading time often determines whether a
              user stays on or abandons a web page. Recognizing the integral
              role of the initial loading speed in user retention, this study
              delves into the realm of performance optimization strategies,
              focusing predominantly on the use of React-like UI frameworks and
              meta-frameworks as a means to improve the initial rendering
              performance of web applications. Through this exploration, we aim
              to provide a comprehensive understanding of contemporary rendering
              approaches and their role in enhancing web application
              performance.<br />To compare the performance impacts of various
              rendering approaches, we implement a React application simulating
              the dynamics of a real-world e-commerce platform and replicate the
              same application through multiple technologies. These technologies
              include the UI frameworks Preact, Qwik, and Solid, as well as the
              meta-frameworks Next, Astro, and Qwik City. Finally, we provide
              extensive benchmarks to measure the page weights and initial
              rendering performance of each application version.<br />Our
              findings demonstrate that the utilization of React-like UI
              frameworks and meta-frameworks can considerably decrease the
              amount of JavaScript downloaded by the client, contributing to
              improved initial rendering times. The most promising results are
              achieved by using meta-frameworks for extending the capabilities
              of UI frameworks with modern rendering strategies like Server-Side
              Rendering and Static Site Generation. However, these approaches
              often present significant trade-offs, such as increased Server
              Response Times and extended build durations.</slot

              >The interactivity and size of web applications have continuously
              increased, resulting in the fact that user interface frameworks
              alone often no longer meet the requirements of modern
              applications. To solve this, one of the latest trends in web
              software development has been using server-side rendering to
              improve the user experience. However, this has made the developer
              experience more complex, as a separate meta-framework must be
              included to achieve desired server-side functionalities. This
              thesis explores current mainstream and upcoming JavaScript web
              frameworks and their techniques by studying front-end frameworks
              and meta-frameworks. The research question the thesis aims to
              answer is: ”What benefits does the latest generation of JavaScript
              web frameworks offer over mainstream ones?” The goal is to find
              the best techniques for future web software development by
              analyzing research and observing practical trends. This is carried
              out through a literature review and by presenting the
              implementations of the selected frameworks. The frameworks
              selected for examination are React, Next, Svelte, Qwik, Astro, and
              HTMX. Many benefits of using upcoming frameworks and novel
              techniques were found. Newer solutions offer smaller runtime
              sizes, more efficient rendering approaches, and often a better
              developer experience. These are achieved by techniques such as
              more extensive compiler use and adopting finely-grained reactivity
              with signals. Most of this progress is incremental, and the
              benefits are mostly relevant for specific use cases. However, Qwik
              uses a technique called resumability, which might fundamentally
              change the currently prevalent server-side rendering by
              eliminating the need for hydration. Lastly, it is important to
              recognize that artificial intelligence will most likely have a
              significant impact on the future of web development.</slot

              >Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have gained
              significant attention both as a research topic as well as a
              platform for entertainment and finance services. The space has
              progressed from just currency to where it is now possible to also
              run a decentralized virtual machine that executes program code
              written on the blockchain. This decentralized virtual machine
              state allows developers to implement transactions and
              authentication that enable payment for services and proving
              ownership of digital assets. Implementing and using these
              technologies, however, has its own security concerns. One popular
              solution for users is a wallet that is conveniently stored in the
              browser and can easily interact with websites. This paper proposes
              how malicious extensions, screenshot attacks, keyloggers, XSS and
              malware could be used to steal private keys from the
              aforementioned browser wallets. It turns out that the secret
              recovery phrase protocol in popular browser wallet applications is
              particularly vulnerable and could be exploited with screenshots or
              keyloggers.</slot
