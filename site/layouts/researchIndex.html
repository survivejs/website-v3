          >Dissertation â€“ Emergence of hybrid rendering models in web
          application development (2025)
        </HeadingWithAnchor>
        <Markdown as="p"
          >Web is the largest application platform available globally as at
          least 60% of humanity has access to it [52]. The situation has been
          enabled by the almost ubiquitous nature of the internet and broad
          access to it. The popularity of the web platform comes with its
          challenges, as it was originally designed for static content and
          evolved to support application development.</Markdown
        ><Markdown as="p"
          >The continuous process of evolution has forced developers to evaluate
          their development practices from time to time. Simultaneously, the
          demands for the quality of web applications have increased and so has
          their size as their size has tripled over the past ten years [22]. The
          development contradicts the global trend of increased web usage
          through mobile devices, where bandwidth and computational power are
          limited by definition. Due to the prevailing trends of increasing
          application size and mobile usage, new, more effective ways to develop
          web applications are needed.</Markdown
        ><Markdown as="p"
          >This dissertation captures the current situation of web development
          while providing directions on how to address the industry's current
          pain points. The dissertation shows how web developers can apply niche
          techniques and technologies to improve their applications on all
          levels while delivering faster and better user experiences without
          forgetting developer experience.</Markdown
        ><Markdown as="p"
          >Examining so-called hybrid rendering techniques and edge computing, I
          show what web development might become in the years to come and
          propose solutions beyond what is available in the mainstream. The
          primary purpose of this dissertation is to explore the space between
          static and dynamic web development to open new venues for web
          developers through novel techniques and technologies without
          forgetting users.</Markdown

          BSc students per semester (Spring, Summer, Fall) at Aalto University
          (a couple of MSc students per year). Usually the works are authored in
          English, although Finnish is an option.</Markdown
