            >Hydration is a common technique employed by
            current JavaScript-based frontend frameworks,
            such as React. In hydration, the application
            code is re-executed on the client to recover
            component boundaries, application state, and
            event listeners. In this article, we look into a
            new primitive called resumability that avoids
            thework as the necessary information is
            serialized into HTML. The idea has been adopted
            by Asta (2023), Google Wiz, Marko (planned for
            version 6 [1]), Sidewind (since 2022), and Qwik
            (2021) as a main building block. Resumability
            gives these solutions unique advantages by
            avoiding the cost of hydration. Furthermore,
            resumability can allow developers to leverage
            code-splitting out of the box, depending on the
            implementation. The shift has implications for
            both developer and user experience. This article
            aims to understand why resumability matters and
            why it is a good option for replacing earlier
            hydration-based approaches. We also consider
            challenges related to adopting resumability on a
            framework level and briefly highlight the first
            resumable solutions for developing web
            applications.</slot

            >A significant portion of the web is powered by
            ECMAScript. As a web technology, it is
            ubiquitous and available on most platforms
            natively or through a web browser. ECMAScript is
            the dominant language of the web, but at the
            same time, it was not designed as such. The
            story of ECMAScript is a story of the impact of
            standardization on the popularity of technology.
            Simultaneously, the story shows how external
            pressures can shape a programming language and
            how politics can mar the evolution of a
            standard. In this article, we will go through
            the movements that led to the dominant position
            of ECMAScript, evaluate the factors leading to
            it, and consider its evolution using the Futures
            Triangle framework and the theory of standards
            wars.</slot

            >The evolution of the web can be characterized
            as an emergence of frameworks paving the way
            from static websites to dynamic web
            applications. As the scope of web applications
            has grown, new technical challenges have
            emerged, leading to the need for new solutions.
            The latest of these developments is the rise of
            so-called disappearing web frameworks that
            question the axioms of earlier generations of
            web frameworks, providing benefits of the early
            web and simple static sites.</slot

            >Static site generation (SSG) is a common
            technique in the web development space to create
            performant websites that are easy to host.
            Numerous SSG tools exist, and the approach has
            been complemented by newer approaches, such as
            Jamstack, that extend its usability. Edge
            computing represents a new option to extend the
            usefulness of SSG further by allowing the
            creation of dynamic sites on top of a static
            backdrop, providing dynamic resources close to
            the user. In this paper, we explore the impact
            of the recent developments in the edge computing
            space and consider its implications for SSG.
