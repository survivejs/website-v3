          >Welcome to survivejs.com. I (Juho Vepsäläinen) have gathered material
          related to JavaScript since 2016. You can consider this site as a
          learning resource at different levels where I have gathered my
          learnings about the topic. Given JavaScript is a broad subject, I have
          divided the site as follows:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <SiteLink href="/books/"
              >In the books section you can find my larger writings about
              JavaScript.</SiteLink
            >
            Currently maintenance,
            <SiteLink href="https://react.dev/">React</SiteLink>, and
            <SiteLink href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</SiteLink> (most up
            to date book) are covered.

          <li>
            <SiteLink href="/blog/"
              >The blog contains numerous of developer interviews (200+) and

          <li>
            <SiteLink href="/research/"
              >In the academic research section you can find my papers about the
              topics.</SiteLink
            >
            I have taken care to include enough background material in my papers
            to keep them accessible so it is not as dry as you might think.
          </li>
          <li>
            <SiteLink href="/workshops/"
              >I have gathered material related to my recent workshops at the
              workshops section of the site.</SiteLink

          >Most of the content is freely available although you can support my
          efforts by buying [books](/books/) or considering some form of
          [consulting](/consulting/). I work mainly around TypeScript, tooling,
          and web performance these days. Through my research efforts I have had
          to delve into the latest rendering techniques and upcoming themes like
          edge computing.

          >This site has been built using [Gustwind](https://gustwind.js.org/),
          my personal framework that is close to HTML with an API familiar to
          users of React. You could consider the site itself as a learning
          resource as I have built it using Tailwind syntax and you can
          copy/paste from the source easily although my custom components have
          been removed from the output although [you can find the custom
          components at
          GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs/website-v3).</Markdown
