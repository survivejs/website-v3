        >Since officially starting my personal limited
        company in 2016, I have occasionally worked as a
        consultant to earn additional income and to develop
        my competence as consulting cases allow me to stay
        grounded in reality. In addition, I've been pursuing
        a doctorate since 2022 with Aalto University. [See
        my research outputs](/research/) if you are
        interested in the academic side.

            >Occasionally I have been hired to perform
            custom development. Example cases include
            developing a complex table component or building
            up a new system in collaboration with a design
            system developer. I understand different aspects
            of modern frontend development well and work
            best in the interface between frontend and
            backend that you might characterize as the
            backend of the frontend.</slot

            >To train up staff, I have run several workshops
            throughout the years in my specialized topics. I
            have focused mainly on webpack and React
            although I have given workshops on topics like
            Deno and Qwik too. These days I prefer a
            hands-on approach and like to run my workshops
            through predesigned katas that allow attendees
            at different levels understand the topic.</slot

            [Future Frontend](https://futurefrontend.com/))
            and have gained a strong understanding on how
            the business works. I have run both physical and
            online events and have operated mainly as a
            conference director focused on the big picture
            (concept, speakers, marketing).</slot

            >Since 2022, I have been working as a researcher
            for Aalto University. Through my research, I
            have learned how the world of scientific
            publishing works. I have not done any commercial
            research cases but I have not ruled out the
            option in case a suitable case becomes
            available. I have done mainly surveys and
            empirical research so I understand both
            qualitative and quantitative ends of the
            spectrum.</slot
