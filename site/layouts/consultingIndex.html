        >Since officially starting my personal limited company in 2016, I have
        occasionally worked as a consultant to earn additional income and to
        develop my competence as consulting cases allow me to stay grounded in
        reality. In addition, I've been pursuing a doctorate since 2022 with
        Aalto University. [See my research outputs](/research/) if you are
        interested in the academic side.

            Example cases include developing a complex table component or
            building up a new system in collaboration with a design system
            developer. I understand different aspects of modern frontend
            development well and work best in the interface between frontend and
            backend that you might characterize as the backend of the
            frontend.</slot

            >To train up staff, I have run several workshops throughout the
            years in my specialized topics. I have focused mainly on webpack and
            React although I have given workshops on topics like Deno and Qwik
            too. These days I prefer a hands-on approach and like to run my
            workshops through predesigned [katas](/workshops/) that allow
            attendees at different levels understand the topic.</slot

            scientific publishing works. I have not done any commercial research
            cases but I have not ruled out the option in case a suitable case
            becomes available. I have done mainly surveys and empirical research
            so I understand both qualitative and quantitative ends of the
            spectrum.</slot
