          >Since officially starting my personal limited company in 2016, I have
          occasionally worked as a consultant to earn additional income and to
          develop my competence as consulting cases allow me to stay grounded in
          reality. In addition, I've been pursuing a doctorate since 2022 at
          [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/fi).

              Example cases include developing a complex table component or
              building up a new system in collaboration with a design system
              developer. I understand different aspects of modern frontend
              development well and work best in the interface between frontend
              and backend that you might characterize as the backend of the
              frontend.</slot

                and dive straight into the topic. I can also provide a short
                lecture on the topic in the beginning if needed.</Markdown

          Generally more specialized and intense work tends to be more expensive
          while lower commitment tends to come with a lower price. I cannot
          guarantee instant or full-time availability, but the situation can
          change fast so it is worth sending a query regardless.
